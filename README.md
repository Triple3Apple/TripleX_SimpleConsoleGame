# TripleX_SimpleConsoleGame
A short puzzle game that involves guessing 3 numbers (the code) given the sum and product
of the three numbers. There are a total of 5 levels that increase in difficulty. This
code features coding convention from Unreal Engine (practicing coding conventions)
Referenced a tutorial* for how to structure this game, but most of the code is implemented 
by me.
